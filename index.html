      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>I am an educator, an artist, and a junior full-stack programmer.</p>
      <p>Born and raised in Memphis, TN, I have a passion for the arts in both visual and musical capacities. At The Univeristy of Memphis, my journey into Education began. After completing my first year, I moved to Dallas, Texas on a whim and moved my schooling to Univeristy of North Texas where I received my degree in Art Education. In this area, my specialities lie in my ability to teach others, my emotional intelligence/soft skills, leadership skills, organization, and time managment. I taught for two years, became bored, and decided to switch fields. My artistic abilities are not to be forgotten -- I have skills in illustration in both traditional and digital mediums. I enjoy creating new color palettes, like the one for this very site, to convey a message before anything is read. Finally, we come to my skills in code and the digital scene. After two years of teaching, I decided to try code. I jumped into TreeHouse Learning first, found that I liked it, and then went to The Iron Yard, a full-stack 16-week course. I learned HTML, CSS, JS, Node, Mongo and Postgres, and finally React and Redux. For my final project, I created an Alexa app with a React front-end and with Node and MongoDB on the bacl-end. You can find the two halves of the project on my GitHub.

      <h2>What CAN you do?</h2>
      <p>I specialize in front-end development, where my ability to create great UI/UX and responsive applications can shine. From my time in education, you'll find that my skills in speaking are up to snuff when explaining tasks and asking questions to others in my team or helping a client who might not know anything about development.</p>
      <h2>Who Do I Want to Do?</h2>
      <p>I get asked this a lot. For now, I am content to learn from others with more skill than me in code.  Eventually, I see myself entering a position of leadership or in some kind of educational capacity, perhaps with juniors? I am still young and getting the feel of the tech field. I have plenty of time to find the right niche for myself, but I am happy to hear about what kinds of positions you can offer to someone with my skills.</p>
